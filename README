This is a capture / backup of the Charity Programming Language source code and a few of the papers.  

The original site at http://pll.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/charity1/www/home.html no longer has functioning links
to any of the papers or downloads, so anyone curious about the Charity Programming Language might have
a difficult time learning about it without any papers or the system itself.

This repo helps to fill that gap by providing the papers and source code.  No attempt has been made to
actually compile the project.

I (Dobes Vandermeer) am not in any way affiliated with the team who invented the Charity Programming
Language, I am merely interested in it and provide these files for the benefit of others who are
also interested.
